CHAPTER 4. PARSING
Now we have all the pieces necessary to operate the parser. Informally,
the idea is to keep a stack that tracks the current state of the parser. In each
step, we consider the top element of the stack and the next token on the
input. If they match, then pop the stack, accept the token, and continue. If not, then consult the parse table for the next rule to apply. If we can
continue until the end-of-ﬁle symbol is matched, then the parse succeeds. LL(1) Table Parsing Algorithm. Given a grammar G with start symbol P and parse table T,

• The parser consumes tokens and groups them together into com-
plete statements and expressions, much like words are grouped into
sentences in a natural language. The parser is guided by a grammar
which states the formal rules of composition in a given language. The output of the parser is an abstract syntax tree (AST) that cap-
tures the grammatical structures of the program. The AST also re-
members where in the source ﬁle each construct appeared, so it is
able to generate targeted error messages, if needed.

Chapters 5 and 6. Parsers are typically driven by tables created from a CFGs
by a parser generator. The parser veriﬁes correct syntax. If a syntax error is found, it issues a
suitable error message. Also, it may be able to repair the error (to form a
syntactically valid program) or to recover from the error (to allow parsing to
be resumed). In many cases, syntactic error recovery or repair can be done
automatically by consulting structures created by a suitable parser generator. As syntactic structure is recognized, the parser usually builds an AST as
a concise representation of program structure. The AST then serves as a basis
for semantic processing.

An input stream is scanned for tokens as discussed in Chapter 3. Tokens deﬁned using regular sets could be processed by scanners that were
constructed automatically from the regular-set speciﬁcations. Just as regular
sets guide the actions of an automatically constructed scanner, so also can the
actions of the parsers described in Chapters 5 and 6 be guided by a grammar
that speciﬁes a programming language’s syntax. 113

Based on the provided context, here's how a parser works:

A parser takes the flat sequence of tokens (words or symbols) from an input stream and builds a tree structure that mirrors the nested nature of the grammar of a programming language. This tree is called a parse tree, abstract syntax tree (AST), or simply "syntax tree".

The parser uses a grammar to guide it in building this tree. The grammar specifies the formal rules of composition in a given language.

Here are the main steps involved:

1. **Tokenization**: The input stream is scanned for tokens.
2. **Matching tokens with grammar rules**: The parser consults the parse table (created from a Context-Free Grammar, CFG) to determine which rule to apply based on the top element of the stack and the next token on the input.
3. **Stack management**: The parser keeps a stack that tracks the current state of the parser.
4. **Synchronization**: If there's an error in parsing (i.e., a token doesn't match the current rule), the parser synchronizes its state by discarding tokens until it reaches one that can appear at the synchronization point.

If the parse succeeds, the parser produces an abstract syntax tree (AST) that captures the grammatical structures of the program. The AST is used for further processing, such as semantic analysis and error reporting.Generated answer: {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the provided context, here\'s how a parser works:\n\nA parser takes the flat sequence of tokens (words or symbols) from an input stream and builds a tree structure that mirrors the nested nature of the grammar of a programming language.
